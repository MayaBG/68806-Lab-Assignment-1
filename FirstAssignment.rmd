# Summarizing the first assignment in the course

In this assignment I created the R project "EcoHydrologywithR"
And also imported an csv file with meteorological data.

I than created and R script called "simple.R"
which reads the data from the file and plots some of it.


```{r simple, include=TRUE}
# simple file to read, analyze and plot

# First we read a set of meteorological observations.
# The file is constructed of a date, hour (24 observation per day, 3 days), temperature and humidity
meteo = read.csv('meteo data.csv',header=T)


# plot data
plot(meteo$hour,meteo$temp,type="p",col="blue",main = "Temperture through the day",xlab = "Hour", ylab = "Temp [C]")

```
